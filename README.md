I did create-react-app today to learn how to use graphQL.  

I learned one key difference is the developer /user is dynamically deciding which data it gets, and there can even be filters and conditions on different fields, making it different from traditional REST endpoints like I used to use with in Django projects.

It was weird to call POST with requests instead of GET, but I did realize I'm sending data with the graph query!

I'm also looking to continue coding in React to see what it's all about.

And I'm using Contentful CMS as a graph to call into.  

I wanted to initially use Strapi, a one stop shop including admin/CMS-too buggy for me
I retreated to Gatsby, a SSG. too buggy for me

with create-react-app calling into contentfuls graph, I can actually start to see how I can run a blog.  Once I build the React site, I can just publish articles on Contentful whenever I feel like and React will automatically ingest with graph calls and component display!

of course, I do feel a little stupid ... considering wix is pretty easy

but it costs $9 a month to remove their ads, and I'm learning GraphQL and React
