I'm building a blog to learn React, GraphQL and to get more comfortable with JavaScript and Node.

I decided to use a cloud CMS/admin for publishing called Contentful.

They have a graphQL api endpoint, so it was convenient for my purposes of learning GraphQL

and the html markdown and media upload satisfied my purposes of easy, manageable blog publishing
